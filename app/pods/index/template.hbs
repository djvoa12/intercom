<pre class="story">Creativity is what drives me. After spending few years as a pricing analyst in a wholesale industry, I was fatigued by a lack of learning, repetitive work, and an overly corporate company culture. I wanted to start anew and spend my time working on something that fuses creativity and logic yet at the same time has an impact on society. With that in mind, I quit my pricing analyst job last year and took a leap into the world of web development, enrolling in Dev Bootcamp (an intense, 90+ hours per week 18 week program) in the hopes of fulfilling my dreams and becoming a web developer. At certain points I was afraid that self-doubt would overtake me, but along the way I constantly asked myself, "why can't I be a success story?".

Now, I have graduated from the program, moved to the great city of San Francisco, where I'm being paid to continuously learn and be creative again. Life is pretty good.
